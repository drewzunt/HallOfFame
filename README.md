This R script takes data from an nflreadR library. Sum the mean EPA of each TE from every season of their career
and plot each of those points on a graph. Then we add a trendline for the career of each player. The output shows that Antonio Gates had 
one of the largest peaks out of any of these first ballot caliber TE's.
