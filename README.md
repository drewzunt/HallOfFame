This R script takes data from an nflreadR library. First, we must mutate the data to clean inconsistent data entries in the database. 
Then, we group the data by each player we want to compare and each season of their career. This allows us to look at the mean EPA of each TE from every season of their career and plot each of those points on a graph. Next, we add a trendline for the career of each player. The output shows that Antonio Gates had one of the most dominant primes of a TE in terms of mean EPA during his playing career. He eclipsed 0.5 EPA in 8 seasons of his career. The next closest TEs to reach this mark are Gronk and Tony Gonzalez who reached it in 5 seasons of their careers, both regarded as the best TEs of all time. Gate's steeper falloff can be attributed to his lengthy playing career, where he started in over 5 games only once in his last 4 seasons. Antonio Gates was not selected to the Hall of Fame on his first ballot in 2024. I argue that Antonio Gates should have been the NFL's second first ballot HOF TE, the first being Tony Gonzalez.
